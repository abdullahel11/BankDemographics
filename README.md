# Banking Demographics Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing banking data to extract key insights about customer demographics, account balances, investments, and other banking-related features. The analysis is based on a synthetic dataset containing customer information, financial history, account activity, and loan details. The project uses SQL, Excel, and Tableau to clean, process, and visualize the data.

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: Used for database creation, data queries, and analysis.
- **Excel**: Used for data cleaning, initial data manipulation, and working with raw datasets.
- **Tableau**: Used for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards to represent the findings.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of various attributes for each customer, such as:
- **Customer Demographics**: Age, occupation, marital status, income level, etc.
- **Account Information**: Account balance, deposits, withdrawals, international transfers, etc.
- **Investment Data**: Amount invested through accounts, risk tolerance, and investment goals.
- **Loan Information**: Loan amount, loan term, interest rate, loan status, etc.

The datasets used in this project contain synthetic customer banking data, which includes various customer attributes such as demographics, account activity, investments, and loan information.

- **Initial Dataset (`Initial.csv`)**: This is the raw dataset that was imported from Excel. It contains the original customer data before any cleaning or processing.
  
- **Final Dataset (`Final.csv`)**: After performing data cleaning and transformation, this is the cleaned version of the dataset, ready for analysis.
